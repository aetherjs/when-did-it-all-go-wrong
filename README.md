## What's all this then?

A prototype react app which for now only tells you how much time has passed since 24th February 2022, 5AM Kiyv/Moscow time (GMT+3). Millions of lifes have been split into before/after by Russian invasion of Ukraine and I need myself a reminder of how long we have been living this ridiculous new life. 

Potential developments:

- Add links to donations/resources
- Add a newsfeed
- Add statistics dashboard, showing casualties and other quantifiable effects of war per time unit

The list is incomplete and if you're seeing this by chance and would like to contribute/help/support, feel free to raise an issue or contact me on telegram @netherjs

## Current Usage

```shell
yarn start
```

To set the dev server going

## Some stuff I might need later for build and deployment
